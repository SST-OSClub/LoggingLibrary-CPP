# Logging Library in C++
A simple multi-purpose logging library written in C++

## How to build and run (For Developement)
0) Ensure a C/C++ compiler is installed on your system. I recommend using `mingw-64` for windows and using your package manager's gcc distribution for linux/mac users.<br>
   You can google "How to install C++ in [windows/mac/linux]" for more information.
1) Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) Verify installation by running `cmake --version`
2) Now you need to setup your build system, to do so follow these steps:-<br>
   For windows users:- If you are using Visual Studio Code, then check out this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGxi500Q5uE) for setting up CMake for vscode<br>
   For linux/mac users:- For ubuntu users, run `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to install `make`. For other distro users, you can install from your respective package managers.<br>
   Verify installation by running `make --version`
3) Now build and run the project<br>
   For windows users:- You can use the run button in the taskbar to build and run the project.<br>
   For linux/mac users:- Make a new folder `build` in the root directory of project. Cd into `build` and run `cmake ..` to setup makefiles. Run `make` to build the project. Then finally run the executable with `./main`.
